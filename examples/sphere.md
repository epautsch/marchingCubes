# Sphere 

Let's consider a sphere centered at the origin with a radius $R$
in a scalar field. The scalar field value at any point $(x, y, z)$ can be 
defined as the distance from the origin 

$$f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$$ 

To represent the surface of the sphere, we choice an isovalue that corresponds to 
the radius of the sphere squared: 

  $$\textbf{isovalue} = R^2$$
